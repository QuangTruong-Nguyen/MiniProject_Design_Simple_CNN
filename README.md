**Objective**: The goal of this exercise is to provide hands-on experience in implementing a 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. By completing this exercise, students will 
gain a better understanding of the key concepts behind CNNs, the PyTorch framework, and 
how to design and train a simple CNN for image classification.
